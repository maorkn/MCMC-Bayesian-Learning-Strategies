# MBS Simulation

This directory contains the core agent-based simulation code for the "Beyond Diffusion: Bayesian Learning Strategies in Single-Cell Life" paper. The simulation is written in Python and is designed to compare the evolutionary dynamics of two types of agents:

*   **Markovian-Bayesian Agents (MBAs):** Learning agents that can build and refine internal models of the environment.
*   **Blind Agents (BAs):** Non-learning agents that rely on fixed, genetically determined strategies.

The simulation code is organized into several subdirectories, including the core simulation logic, agent definitions, and wrappers for running experiments and analyzing results.
