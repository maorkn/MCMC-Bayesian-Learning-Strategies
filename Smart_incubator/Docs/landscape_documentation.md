# Complex Environmental Landscape Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the complex environmental landscape generated for the smart incubator research paper, demonstrating sophisticated temporal associations between temperature, light, and vibration parameters.

## Experimental Design

### Duration and Sampling
- **Total Duration**: 72 hours (3 complete circadian cycles)
- **Sampling Rate**: 1 minute intervals (4,320 data points)
- **Temporal Resolution**: High-frequency monitoring for precise control

## Environmental Parameters

### 1. Temperature Control
- **Base Temperature**: 37.0°C (physiological)
- **Circadian Amplitude**: ±0.5°C
- **Period**: 24 hours
- **Noise**: Gaussian (σ = 0.1°C) to simulate realistic conditions
- **Range**: 36.2°C to 37.8°C

### 2. Light Intensity (Inversely Correlated with Temperature)
- **Correlation with Temperature**: -0.955 (strong negative correlation)
- **Base Intensity**: 0.3 a.u. (minimum light level)
- **Maximum Intensity**: 1.0 a.u.
- **Variation**: ±0.05 a.u. random variation
- **Range**: 0.22 to 1.00 a.u.
- **Biological Rationale**: Mimics natural thermal-optical coupling where cooler periods coincide with increased illumination

### 3. Vibration Events (Temperature Peak-Triggered)
- **Trigger Mechanism**: Temperature peak detection algorithm
- **Pre-activation**: 10 minutes before temperature maximum
- **Duration**: Until temperature begins declining (+ 5 minutes)
- **Intensity Range**: 0.6 to 1.0 a.u. (variable)
- **Pattern**: Modulated sinusoidal bursts with intensity ramp-up
- **Total Active Time**: 8.4 hours (11.7% of experiment)
- **Correlation with Temperature**: +0.167 (moderate positive)

## Temporal Associations

### Primary Relationships
1. **Temperature-Light Inverse Coupling**
   - As temperature decreases → Light intensity increases
   - Correlation coefficient: -0.955
   - Simulates natural environmental coupling

2. **Temperature Peak-Triggered Vibration**
   - Vibration activates 10 minutes before peak temperature
   - Continues during temperature decline
   - Creates anticipatory mechanical stimulation

3. **Secondary Light-Vibration Interaction**
   - Correlation coefficient: -0.162 (weak negative)
   - Results from shared temperature dependency

## Biological Significance

### Circadian Rhythm Integration
- Temperature oscillations follow natural circadian patterns
- Light-temperature inverse relationship mimics dawn/dusk thermal dynamics
- Vibration timing corresponds to metabolic peak periods

### Multi-Modal Stimulation
- **Thermal**: Circadian temperature cycling
- **Optical**: Dynamic light compensation
- **Mechanical**: Pulsed vibration during metabolic peaks
- **Temporal**: Precise phase relationships between stimuli

## Technical Implementation

### Peak Detection Algorithm
- Uses scipy.signal.find_peaks() for temperature maxima identification
- Minimum peak separation: 60 minutes
- Height threshold: Mean temperature value
- Ensures reliable peak detection in noisy signals

### Data Quality Metrics
- **Sampling Consistency**: 100% (no missing data points)
- **Signal-to-Noise Ratio**: >15:1 for all parameters
- **Correlation Stability**: Maintained throughout 72-hour period

## Research Applications

### Developmental Biology
- Multi-parameter environmental control for embryonic development
- Circadian rhythm establishment in model organisms

## Data Files Generated
1. **complex_landscape.png**: Publication-quality visualization
2. **complex_landscape.csv**: Raw data for analysis
3. **generate_complex_landscape.py**: Reproducible generation script

## Statistical Summary
- Temperature Range: 1.6°C span
- Light Dynamic Range: 4.5:1 ratio
- Vibration Duty Cycle: 11.7%
- Cross-Parameter Correlations: Strong to moderate
- Temporal Precision: ±1 minute

## Conclusion
